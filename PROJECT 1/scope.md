# Project Scope Statement

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to apply the project management principle of scoping to a tangible technical task. By defining clear objectives, deliverables, and boundaries before development begins, this project demonstrates how effective planning improves focus, efficiency, and outcomes in technical work.

## Project Description
This project involves creating two deliverables: a formal scope statement written in Markdown and a simple, single-page personal website built with semantic HTML. The scope statement outlines the intent, expected results, and limitations of the project, while the website serves as a practical implementation of the defined scope. The website introduces the student, highlights professional or academic interests, and demonstrates foundational HTML structure and best practices.

## Desired Results
- A completed scope statement following the PMUPM Chapter 3 template  
- A valid HTML document that meets all stated technical requirements  
- Clear alignment between the defined scope and the final technical deliverable  
- Improved understanding of how scoping guides and constrains project work  
- Demonstrated ability to translate planning documentation into execution  

## Exclusions
- Visual design enhancements such as CSS styling  
- Interactive functionality using JavaScript  
- Backend systems, databases, or server-side logic  
- Deployment or hosting of the webpage  
- Additional pages beyond the single required HTML file
