# Project Scope Statement

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to apply the project management principle of scoping to a tangible technical task. I want to define clear objectives, deliverables, and limitations before development begins. I hope this project demonstrates how effective my planning is in improving focus, efficiency, and outcomes in technical work. I have yet to learn more and understand the concept. I want to deliver exceptional work and be task-oriented so that I can learn and apply the skills I gain in this class. 

## Project Description
This project consists of creating two types of documents. The 1st one is a project scope statement written in Markdown and based on chapter 3 of our reading. Next is a simple, single-page personal website built using semantic HTML. The scope statement inlcudes the project's purpose, expectations, and boundaries, while the HTML webpage provides a practical implementation of that scope by presenting personal and professional information and making it live in a form of a page online document. 

## Desired Results
- This project shold be similar to scope statement that follows the PMUPM Chapter 3 template.
- A valid HTML document that meets all assignments requirments (e.g element, a main heading, subheading, un ordered list,...)
- Improved understanding of scope definition and scope control   

## Exclusions
- Website deployment or hosting.
- Additional pages beyond the single required HTML files. 
- commit files in VS code.
- push files to publish to gifthub.
- upload links and docs to canvas.
